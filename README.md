# Mixxtape
Send someone a message with a mixtape! 

Mixxtape connects with your Spotify account and creates a new playlist given some artist names and a message. The playlist will spell out your message in an acrostic format (using the first letter of each song), and all of the songs will be from the given or related artists. After your playlist is made, just share the playlist link with someone to send them the message!
